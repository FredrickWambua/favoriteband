                    <h1>About Imagine Dragons</h1><hr>

                    <p>
                        Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their limitless passion and genre-bending
                        sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs that quickly earned a grassroots following. 
                        Over the last half-decade, Imagine Dragons have emerged as one of the biggest and most compelling rock bands in the world. 
                        Within a year of its June 2017 release, their third studio album <strong>EVOLVE</strong> went double-platinum, yielding three back-to-back 
                        #1 singles: <em>Believer</em>, <em>Thunder</em>, and <em>It Takes</em>. 
     
                        Self-identifying as “genreless,” Imagine Dragon artfully blends rock, hip-hop, pop, and folk with their lyrics 
                        that speak to a sometimes-painful self-awareness, but ultimately uplift and inspire.
